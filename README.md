# illumos-omnios

This is the OmniOS fork of the core [illumos](https://illumos.org) source tree.

## Building

In general, and for least surprise, OmniOS must be built on an OmniOS system of
the same version. See the
[build instructions](https://omnios.org/dev/build_instructions) for further
information.

## Contributing

The OmniOS fork is regularly updated with changes from the upstream
[illumos-gate](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate). Contributions to
OmniOS are also welcome via Github pull requests.

## Contact

Contact details for OmniOS can be found on
[our web site](https://omnios.org/about/contact).

## Community

The illumos community is small but active. We welcome everybody who would like
to use the software and participate in the community -- whether you have
decades of experience in systems software, or you're just getting started;
whether you work for a company that uses illumos, or you just find it
personally interesting.

The [Community guide](https://illumos.org/docs/community/) includes details
about Mailing Lists and IRC channels.

## Licence

Most of the existing code is licensed under the
[CDDL](https://illumos.org/license/CDDL) and we expect new code will generally
be under this licence as well. Modifications of existing code may not alter
the original license terms. Integrations of code from upstream sources that
use another open source license are generally permissible.
